x2gokdrive (0.0.0.1-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * Calculate screen dimensions (in mm) according to dpi value. Default DPI (Xorg) is 75. User can set DPI using -dpi command line option.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * Initial release:
    - patches.legacy/README.legacy-patches.md: whitespace-only fix.
    - patches.legacy/README.legacy-patches.md: fix markdown syntax.
    - {./,patches.xorg/{common,1.18.4,1.19.{2,6},1.20.{1,4,5}}/}quilt.env: add
      new quilt environment helper mechanism. Should make using quilt a lot
      easier on the developer's machine. Requires SOURCING(!) the quilt.env
      file within a specific versioned sub-directory OR SOURCING(!) the
      top-level quilt.env file and exporting QUILT_PATCHES manually.
  * debian/control:
    + Grammar fix.
    + Remove dependencies that refer to disabled features.
  * x2gokdrive.spec:
    + Drop Debian-style formatting in description.
    + Typo fixes.
    + Remove empty line at EOF.
    + Copy summary from Debian's short description.
    + Spell out each (build) dependency on one line.
    + Whitespace-only fixes.
    + Backport changes from debian/rules.
    + Copy *.la file removal mechanism from debian/rules.
    + Pull in lsb-release on *SuSE systems and redhat-lsb otherwise for
      lsb_release, needed at package configuration time.
    + Enable hardening in a low-effort way.
    + Disable debugsource... disabling. Debug packages are actually useful!
    + Copy configure flags from debian/rules{,.flags}. Most compiler flags
      should be getting passed down automatically through the %configure
      macro, but CPPFLAGS is special and seemingly not defined in
      redhat-rpm-macros (or the *SuSE equivalent) and is hence passed-down
      manually. %{__global_ldflags} is empty and unknown on some systems, so
      copy workaround from nx-libs for that one.
    + Sync dependency lists with debian/control.
    + Rename binary package to xorg-x11-server-x2gokdrive to be consistent
      with Fedora/*SuSE package naming.
    + It's still %endif, not %fi.
    + Let description be the description of xorg-x11-server-x2gokdrive, not
      the x2gokdrive source package.
    + Add/copy Summary tag to xorg-x11-server-x2gokdrive binary package.
    + Add description for x2gokdrive (source) package. It's a slightly
      modified version of the binary package description.
    + Fix typo pkgconfig(Xau) => pkgconfig(xau).
    + Backport escaping layer change from debian/rules.
    + Fix %autosetup usage - only use it when supported. RPM 4.11.x+.
    + %autosetup (or %setup) create a top-level BUILD directory into which the
      source tarball is extracted - but we also need a BUILD sub-directory.
      Create it.
    + Use pushd instead of cd. Minor change.
    + Build-depend upon libgcrypt-devel for "older" distros that don't define
      a libgcrypt pkgconfig() virtual provide. That means: Fedora < 29, EPEL <
      8 and any *SuSE version that is not Tumbleweed. The most surprising part
      is probably *SuSE.
    + Untangle libjpeg-turbo-devel build-dependency. Recent *SuSE versions
      define a pkgconfig(libturbojpeg) virtual provide, which is unheard of in
      RHEL land. Older *SuSE versions sadly don't have any virtual provide for
      this, and, worse, don't even have libjpeg-turbo-devel packages, so we'll
      need to build-depend upon libjpeg62-devel instead and hope that this is
      actually the turbo variant. RHEL-land (including Fedora) is more
      forgiving and always ships the turbo variant, but sets the virtual
      provide to pkgconfig(libjpeg) (yes, for all versions down to RHEL 6,
      albit via the updates repository!) and do not mention "turbo" in there.
    + Rework gettext-autopoint build dependency. *SuSE uses gettext-tools
      (which provides a virtual gettext-devel package), while RHEL-land has a
      "real" gettext-devel package that virtually provides a gettext-autopoint
      package.
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove weird empty variable reference construct.
    + Whitespace-only fixes.
    + Move options to the front of commands.
    + Drop useless use of cat.
    + Avoid backticks, use $() instead.
    + "a && b || c" doesn't really mean "if a then b else c", but something...
      more difficult: "c" does also run if "a" is false. Switch to a proper
      if-else construct.
    + Split up subshell content onto unique lines and fix bash syntax error
      near "exit 1".
    + Use printf instead of echo. Plain echo doesn't even substitute escape
      sequences for their plain char counterparts and the -e switch is
      non-portable.
    + Avoid xargs, use find's -exec feature.
    + More and better quoting.
    + Verbosely remove *.la files.
    + Add missing single quotes - two strings were merged into one by
      accident.
    + Drop additional escape layer in sed expression. This was previously only
      needed due to the weird escaping/quoting rules for code in backticks.
      The more modern and equally POSIX-compatible $() syntax makes quoting
      and escaping within subshell calls a lot easier.
  * debian/rules.flags:
    + Define NULL variable and use it throughout the file.
