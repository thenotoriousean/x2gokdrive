x2gokdrive (0.0.0.1-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * Calculate screen dimensions (in mm) according to dpi value. Default DPI (Xorg) is 75. User can set DPI using -dpi command line option.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * debian/control:
    + Grammar fix.
  * x2gokdrive.spec:
    + Drop Debian-style formatting in description.
    + Typo fixes.
    + Remove empty line at EOF.
    + Copy summary from Debian's short description.
    + Spell out each (build) dependency on one line.
    + Whitespace-only fixes.
    + Backport changes from debian/rules.
    + Copy *.la file removal mechanism from debian/rules.
    + Pull in lsb-release on *SuSE systems and redhat-lsb otherwise for
      lsb_release, needed at package configuration time.
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove weird empty variable reference construct.
    + Whitespace-only fixes.
    + Move options to the front of commands.
    + Drop useless use of cat.
    + Avoid backticks, use $() instead.
    + "a && b || c" doesn't really mean "if a then b else c", but something...
      more difficult: "c" does also run if "a" is false. Switch to a proper
      if-else construct.
    + Split up subshell content onto unique lines and fix bash syntax error
      near "exit 1".
    + Use printf instead of echo. Plain echo doesn't even substitute escape
      sequences for their plain char counterparts and the -e switch is
      non-portable.
    + Avoid xargs, use find's -exec feature.
    + More and better quoting.
    + Verbosely remove *.la files.
